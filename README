A script to enable laptop power saving features for #! & Debian GNU+linux.
Generally speaking, this script should automatically switch powertop's
"Tunables" which proved to make significant impact in power consumption
while running on battery.

Adjusted for Debian Wheezy on Lenovo T410 by Donn√© Brok / info@donux.nl

To make this script run each time laptop's power adapter is plugged in/out:
cp powersave /etc/pm/power.d/
chmod +x /etc/pm/power.d/powersave

To run script manually:
./powersave true|false
